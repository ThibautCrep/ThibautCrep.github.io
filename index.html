							<h2>University of summer 2017</h2>
							<p>For the past summer, my school, IÃ‰SEG School of Management, ordered an entire graphic identity for their international event about the future of management. It was by far my most ambitious project, where I had to deal with and respond to requests in a short period of time. I had to do posters, flyers, photo holders... Here is an example of an invitation.</p>
